It calls a series of FSL programs to strip the non-brain tissue from the two images, register the two brains (under the constraint that the skulls are used to hold the scaling constant during the registration) and analyse the brain change between the two time points. It is also possible to project the voxelwise atrophy measures into standard space in a way that allows for multi-subject voxelwise statistical testing."	
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MRIO_0000517>	"We set out to develop and validate an LVV quantification tool for this purpose. Our goal was not to produce a method more precise or accurate than those described above. Rather, we sought to produce a highly robust technique capable of operating on clinical-quality T2-FLAIR images and producing results similar to more established techniques run on high-resolution scans. To do this, we extended an earlier idea for whole brain analysis proposed by (Baillard et al., 2001), and adapted it to LVV measurement on T2-FLAIR images. The core of our approach is a combination of multi-atlas segmentation and level-set refinement. We also extended the cross-sectional method for direct longitudinal analysis by including an optional Jacobian integration step. We called the resulting algorithm “Neurological Software Tool for Reliable Atrophy Measurement” - NeuroSTREAM."

<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MRIO_0000525>	"Quantitative measurement of brain size, shape, and temporal change (for example, in order to estimate atrophy) is increasingly important in biomedical image analysis applications. New methods of structural analysis attempt to improve robustness, accuracy, and extent of automation. A fully automated method of longitudinal (temporal change) analysis, SIENA, was presented previously. In this paper, improvements to this method are described, and also an extension of SIENA to a new method for cross-sectional (single time point) analysis. The methods are fully automated, robust, and accurate: 0.15% brain volume change error (longitudinal): 0.5–1% brain volume accuracy for single-time point (cross-sectional). A particular advantage is the relative insensitivity to differences in scanning parameters. The methods provide easy manual review of their output by the automatic production of summary images which show the results of the brain extraction, registration, tissue segmentation, and final atrophy estimation."

(Çiçek et al., 2016) The U-Net architecture is composed of two symmetric pathways – a descending contraction/encoding pathway which moves from low level voxel intensities at very high spatial resolution to abstract high-level features at coarse spatial resolution, and an ascending expansion/decoding pathway which moves from less localized high-level features to specific voxel classifications. Additionally, U-Net includes direct “skip” connections from the descending pathway into the ascending pathway, to provide the ascending pathway with low-level image feature information. In the current context, the descending pathway is essentially responsible for localizing the thalamus, and the ascending pathway is responsible for determining its precise borders."

It has evolved from a package primarily aimed at generating surface representations of the cerebral cortex into one that automatically creates models of most macroscopically visible structures in the human brain given any reasonable T1-weighted input image. It is freely available, runs on a wide variety of hardware and software platforms, and is open source."

Binary lesion maps of these patients were used as response values. As covariates a similar lesion belief map as for the LGA was used as well as a spatial covariate that takes into account voxel specific changes in lesion probability. Such a high dimensional model cannot be estimated by standard procedures, so we used a novel approach for fitting large-scale regression models, for details see here. The parameters of this model fit are then used to segment lesions in new images by providing an estimate for the lesion probability for each voxel."
